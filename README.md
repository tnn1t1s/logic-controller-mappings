# Logic Plugin Controller Mapping Project

This is an open project by Abril Studios to explore and document how to map common MIDI controllers to plugin parameters in Logic Proâ€”especially for recreating workflows like Softube Console 1 without being locked into proprietary hardware.

We believe controller mappings should be portable, editable, and artist-owned.

## Project Goals

- Decode Logic Pro's controller mapping format
- Build reusable templates for common plugin strips (SSL, API, Neve, etc.)
- Allow generic MIDI controllers to act like Console 1-style surfaces
- Release open tools to facilitate mapping and sharing
