# Logic Plugin Controller Mapping Project

This is an open project by Abril Studios to explore and document how to map common MIDI controllers to plugin parameters in Logic Proâ€”especially for recreating workflows like Softube Console 1 without being locked into proprietary hardware.

We believe controller mappings should be portable, editable, and artist-owned.

## Project Goals

- Decode Logic Pro's controller mapping format
- Build reusable templates for common plugin strips (SSL, API, Neve, etc.)
- Allow generic MIDI controllers to act like Console 1-style surfaces
- Release open tools to facilitate mapping and sharing

## Progress Update

We've started work on decoding Logic Pro's controller assignment file format (`com.apple.logic.pro.cs`). Initial investigation has revealed:

- The file has a structured binary format with identifiable markers
- It contains readable controller names and OSC-style control paths
- Mappings appear to follow consistent patterns

We've created several tools to aid in the investigation:
- `src/decode_logic_cs.py`: Main decoder for the CS file format
- `tools/cs_analyzer.py`: Basic structural analysis tool
- `tools/cs_diff.py`: Compares different versions of CS files
- `tools/cs_monitor.py`: Monitors CS file changes in real-time

For detailed findings, see the [PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md) document.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Back up your existing controller assignments file:
   ```bash
   cp ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.logic.pro.cs ./samples/my_backup.cs
   ```
3. Run the decoder to analyze your file:
   ```bash
   python3 src/decode_logic_cs.py ./samples/my_backup.cs
   ```

## Controller Mappings

We are developing standardized mappings for popular MIDI controllers:

- [Korg nanoKONTROL2](controllers/nanokontrol2/) - For SSL Channel Strip
